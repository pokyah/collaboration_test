## what we have done so far 

1. pasting each member public SSH key in repository setting so that everyone can collaborate on the upstream repository without the need to ask for pull requests.
2. each collaborator `git clone` the online github repository on his iwn computer :

```bash
git@github.com:pokyah/collaboration_test.git
```
